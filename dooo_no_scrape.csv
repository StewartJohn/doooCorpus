Richard V. Hurley,Huffington Post,A Place of One's Own — Online,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-v-hurley/a-place-of-ones-own-onlin_b_4109566.html,2014-01-23,"I've been writing in these pages about the intersection of technology and pedagogy at colleges of the liberal arts and sciences. I've essentially been arguing that although America needs technicians and technocrats, and though that may seem where the jobs are these days, the value of a liberal arts and sciences education cannot be underestimated. But I also think that liberal arts institutions must recognize that they are well into the 21st century, the ""digital age."" The technology of today, if it is used effectively, can be a great asset and lever for teaching. And it is incumbent on us at the universities to give our students the tools to succeed in our web-based world. Already, our students come to the University of Mary Washington as inhabitants and consumers of cyberspace. Cyberspace is where they share ideas, seek entertainment, communicate, search for information and answers. We need to help them use that space better, even master it if that is possible. For years, Mary Washington has had a very successful blogging platform. It has been used for classwork, to create literary journals, for student reports on their travel abroad, for club postings, and for alumni bulletin boards. It now has 8,500 users. But recently we came up with a potentially more exciting idea. We call it ""Domain of One's Own."" The Domain of One's Own initiative urges and coaches our students to set up their own individual websites. The initiative was propelled by several related ideas: The first was that students could use their sites to host, show, and promote their scholarship and research. The websites could serve as digital portfolios showcasing the students' resumes and best academic work for potential employers. And students would carry these URLs with them well beyond graduation. Second, the very act of building a website would be a great learning experience - it would allow students to grapple with how things are created on the web. And it would teach students how to create websites for others, an important and marketable skill. Third, for those whose ideas really take flight, the student domains would be the digital presentation of themselves, a way to explore their digital identities. They would not just be a marketing tool but a way for students and graduates to put their ideas, thoughts, writing, poetry, music, and videos, out there for others to contemplate, to respond to, or just enjoy. Domain of One's Own started as a pilot project in 2012 with 400 students participating. This year we rolled it out for the entire incoming freshman class. Mary Washington pays for every new freshman to acquire his or her own domain name and the university contracts for Wordpress and web hosting. If what our first users have done on the web is predictive, the initiative will be a great success. Hassan Halim, from the class of 2010, created a site called http://hirehassan.com, his online portfolio. ""I saw people printing out resumes, but I put everything online,"" he said. ""And I put my website on my card so people could find it."" Hassan also used his website building experience to create sites for others, including sites for a school board candidate and a Psi Upsilon fraternity chapter, and he created other personal sites to show his videos and his writing. Caitlin Murphy, a 2012 graduate, created http://caitlinpringlemurphy.com/ as a self-marketing tool and used it for all of her job applications. If you get a chance to view the site, you will see that it is well-organized and has a fresh, clean look. Caitlin is sure it helped her land her job at PBS: ""The woman interviewing me said she'd been impressed by my website and it was one of the reasons she called me."" One of our 2013 graduates, Haley Campbell, saw virtually no limit to what could be done. Her site, at http://aetherbunny.com, holds her college work and scholarship, personal musings and ramblings, daily writing, her videos and photographs. Haley said she had wanted to do something like this for some time but did not have the money or the time to do it on her own. She also created an art and literary journal online called http://stitchjournal.com which she shows as part of her resume. ""Having the skills to create a website using a Wordpress platform is extremely valuable to many employers,"" she says. She just started working to improve the website of a campground association. The University of Mary Washington has been lauded for this digital initiative, and it has been written that we are the first university to do this. We certainly hope that others pick up on the idea. Jim Groom, our Director of Teaching and Learning Technologies, puts it this way: ""We want to make emerging technologies central to the university experience, not an afterthought. We are building the web into the fabric of how we teach and learn here."" "
Marguerite McNeal,EdSurge News,BYU's Bold Plan to Give Students Control of Their Data,https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-12-18-byu-s-bold-plan-to-give-students-control-of-their-data,2015-01-18,"As Web culture permeates the higher education experience, from Yik Yak conversations to collaborative digital assignments, questions of data privacy are gaining national attention. In 2015, 46 states introduced 182 bills addressing student data privacy, according to nonprofit advocacy group the Data Quality Campaign. These attempts to protect personal information treat student data as something to be managed and controlled—but don't give students themselves a voice in how they want their data to be used. Jim Groom, who spearheaded the Domain of One's Own effort as director of technologies at the University of Mary Washington, thinks there's a better way. He's working with Brigham Young University (BYU) on a personal API concept that would let students decide what they share, with whom and for how long. ""We're building a system that de-centers the control of data, so that students can control their own information,"" Groom says. A personal API builds on the domain concept—students store information on their site, whether it's class assignments, financial aid information or personal blogs, and then decide how they want to share that data with other applications and services. The idea is to give students autonomy in how they develop and manage their digital identities at the university and well into their professional lives. Domain of One's Own Since UMW introduced Domain of One's Own in 2013, more than 30 universities have followed suit. They're giving students and faculty domain names and Web spaces and letting them experiment. Users publish coursework, build portfolios or tinker with personal projects, for example. The idea springs from what Phil Windley, an enterprise architect at BYU, calls sovereign source identity—the notion that your identity comes from within you and not from someone else. It's the opposite of what happens in many online transactions today. Facebook, Google and even universities give users identities, Windley says. When individuals share personal information with these services, their data lives inside the organizations' administrative domain and they have little to no control over what happens next. ""We want to teach students that this isn't the only way identity happens online. They can create their own,"" Windley says. This fall BYU introduced its Domain of One's Own pilot to 1,000 student and faculty participants. But offering personal Web spaces is just the beginning, Windley says. ""Domains help students understand their personal identity. The next step is understanding your personal data and how you control that."" Domains as Gateways A personal API radically changes the relationship between data owners and users. In the university context, it works like this: Students store their information in their personal domains and grant other sites and applications access to that data as they see fit. Perhaps they want an app to access their course enrollment data for exactly one semester, or they want to share only certain portions of their portfolio with their professor. In theory, a personal API creates a more egalitarian relationship between the person sharing data and the entity that wants to use it. ""It's the idea that tapping into one's data should be a negotiation that the student gets to make,"" says Adam Croom, director of digital learning at the Center for Teaching Excellence at the University of Oklahoma (OU). ""Why can't I manage what apps tap into my data, whether that's the learning management system or the bursar's office? Why aren't there terms and conditions for students to understand who has access to their data?"" OU launched its Domain of One's Own initiative, called OU Create, in fall 2014 and is also working on API programs at a system level. At BYU, Windley and his colleagues have been working on a university API, which will make the school's data easily accessible so that developers can build applications that use it. Now they're figuring out how student and faculty APIs could interact with a broader one developed by the university. BYU teamed up with Groom and his company Reclaim Hosting, which provides domains and Web hosting to educators and institutions, to use domains as the hosting platform for personal APIs. Reclaim and BYU will test personal APIs this spring. Once students have a domain, they'll be able to install applications that allow their data to talk to other programs, such as a learning management system. From their domain site, users will have the option to publish work and share data with different spaces, including social media and class sites, and control privacy settings to decide which other sites can access their information. From Data Owner to Arbiter A personal API linked with a domain puts students at the center of their learning experience. Windley says he sees the combination as a key to lifelong learning. In managing their data and taking their work with them well beyond their academic life, students become active participants in their education, rather than passive consumers, he says. As with domains, not every student and faculty wants to use a personal API. The project is as much about opting out as opting in, Groom says. He doesn't anticipate that all 30,000 BYU students will sign up for a personal API. Instead he says he hopes the project will provide a proof of concept that students and faculty care about using data in radically different ways to gain more control over the work and information they produce. ""It's not a final solution that should be pushed on anyone. It's a platform for people to experiment with, to control and manage and work through this question of identity on the Web."" "
Laura Moyer,Great Minds,At Home on the Web,http://www.umw.edu/greatminds/2013/02/11/at-home-on-the-web/,2013-02-11,"As a kid in the '90s and '00s, Haley Campbell '13 grew up with the Internet. She played computer games, learned to type from an educational software program, and experimented with blogs and fan fiction. In middle school, she tinkered with HTML coding and creating a website. As moms and dads do, Campbell's parents urged her to be safe on the Web. But they didn't discourage her interest, even if they didn't see the attraction. As Campbell puts it, ""Every generation comes up with something that the previous generation shakes their head and says, ‘Really guys? Is that what you're going to do?' "" Haley Campbell uses her aetherbunny.com domain for a multitude of digital projects. But it wasn't until she got to the University of Mary Washington and enrolled in classes on new media that Campbell started thinking analytically about the Internet's potential to educate on a macro scale, and to swiftly shape and change consensus. ""It's so obvious that this was where a ton of extremely important communication was taking place,"" she said. In addition to taking classes such as digital storytelling – called ds106 – Campbell is among about 400 people piloting Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own initiative, which started last fall. The program, offered in collaboration with the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT) and the office of Information Technology Services, provides domains and Web hosting for students and faculty. While Domain of One's Own is intentionally unstructured – the idea is for users to define for themselves what they will present on the Web – it encourages students to own and control their online presence. Some may use their domains strictly as e-portfolios. Others, including Campbell, take a broader approach. Campbell's aetherbunny.com domain is constantly evolving. She's used it for her digital storytelling projects; as an academic blog; as a creative outlet for short stories and poetry; and as a forum for experimenting with online editing tools. Exploring the possibilities of the Web just makes sense to Campbell. ""A lot of people take the Internet for granted. They know they have to use it, but they don't necessarily think about how they're using it,"" she said. Domain of One's Own, a nod to Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, encourages ""critical thinking about those tools."" The Web can be used badly, of course, in prefab, uninspired ways. But it also can be, she said, ""a brilliant, beautiful smorgasbord of creativity."" And it's important not to think of the Internet as a monolithic entity, she said. ""It's a massive collection of networked tools we can use and take control of if we're willing to put in the time and energy."" One example of that is what Campbell calls curating, the constant re-evaluating and editing of one's online presence. That can involve removing content, but it may more effectively entail updating existing content. For example, a college senior entering the professional world might use her personal domain to acknowledge an essay she posted as a teenager, but add a note reflecting how her views have changed. Taking that thoughtful approach through the college years can reduce seniors' anxiety that graduate schools or potential employers will turn up embarrassing teenage blogs, photos, or tweets. ""The more aggressively you prune and update your personal Web presence,"" she said, ""the more recent stuff people will find."" Tim Owens, instruction technology specialist and co-creator of Domain of One's Own, applauds Campbell's resourcefulness. ""Haley's experience of exploring and controlling her digital identity is what we want for all students at Mary Washington,"" Owens said. ""Some students may choose to continue using spaces like Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter, but the important part is that we are handing control of those choices to the students and providing them the opportunity to explore what's out there and how they can define themselves online."" Campbell gets why participating in Domain of One's Own is not required of students, and she respects that some people just aren't all that interested in crafting an online presence. But she leapt on it. ""It's like being handed this massive box of toys and being told you can play with it if you want to, but you don't have to,"" she said with a laugh. An English major with a concentration in creative writing, Campbell sees her UMW classes and Domain of One's Own opening professional opportunities. She's exploring educational technology and methods of open education such as massive open online courses, or MOOCs. She's learning ""the pedagogical aspects of it – how teachers are teaching, and what they're teaching about."" And as an accomplished poet – and 2013 winner of the UMW Barbara Thomas Phillips Creative Writing Scholarship – she's evaluating the many tools writers use to find readership beyond traditional publications. She's also finding creative inspiration online, exploring new ways to use words, art, music, and online immediacy to shape narratives. But while she's part of the generation that will expand what's possible online, she hasn't lost sight of what drew her to the Web in the first place. ""Really,"" Campbell said, ""I've been telling stories on the Internet for most of my life."" "
Brynn Boyer,UMW News & Media Relations,UMW Freshmen Build Digital Identities Through Innovative Project,http://www.umw.edu/news/2013/08/13/umw-freshmen-build-digital-identities-through-innovative-project/,2013-08-13,"This fall, incoming freshmen at the University of Mary Washington will have the opportunity to create their digital identities through the Domain of One's Own initiative. The pioneering project provides free, personal domain names and web hosting to help students take responsibility for their online identities, as well as explore the implications of what it might mean for them to take control of their work and manage their own portfolios. Domain of One's Own reinforces UMW as a leader in higher education, according to Director of Teaching and Learning Technologies Jim Groom, since it is evidence that emerging technologies are central to the university's student and faculty experience, not afterthoughts. ""Domain of One's Own is an opportunity to build on a tradition we have had for the past 10 years to build the Web into the curriculum,"" said Groom, whom the Chronicle of Higher Education named one of a dozen top tech innovators in 2012. ""UMW is one of the first [colleges and universities] to think about this in a central way. Mary Washington is suggesting and doing something radically different. We are building the Web into the fabric of how we teach and learn here."" Domain of One's Own started as a pilot project in 2012, with more than 400 students and 30 faculty participating. It is the brainchild of Groom and his colleagues in the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies. The initiative has two main goals, Instructional Technology Specialist Tim Owens explained, with the first focused on the value of archives and portfolios for students' future professional and academic endeavors. ""The other side of it is that it is valuable for students just to inhabit the Web and understand how the Web works,"" he said. ""It's important for us to have those conversations with students about how stuff happens on the Web and how they can control it.""   Haley Campbell '13 has used her domain as a portfolio and academic blog. Haley Campbell '13 has used her http://aetherbunny.com/ domain as everything from a portfolio to an academic blog to a place to experiment with online editing tools. ""A lot of people take the Internet for granted,"" Campbell said. ""They know they have to use it, but they don't necessarily think about how they're using it. [Domain of One's Own] encourages critical thinking about those tools."" The initiative has created a buzz on and off campus, including in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Wired, The Web Host Industry Review and The Center for Digital Education. The idea for the initiative started when the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies' staff received their own domains and web spaces in 2004. ""Two years later, after we saw how it empowered us in so many ways, we informally banded around this idea of ‘wouldn't it be cool if we could give this to every student?'"" said Martha Burtis, special projects coordinator. ""It really evolved over about 10 years to where we are now."" For Burtis, Domain of One's Own isn't just about technology, it's about transforming students through meaningful interactions. ""That kind of empowerment is huge in terms of what we can do for our students,"" she said. "
David Raths,Campus Technology,An E-Portfolio With No Limits,https://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/02/an-e-portfolio-with-no-limits.aspx,2014-04-02,"Students at the University of Mary Washington build their academic identities on their own personal Web domain. As many universities look to certifications, badges and e-portfolios as vehicles to allow students to demonstrate their achievements and skills, another movement has begun to surface on campus: a personal web domain for each student. At the University of Mary Washington (Fredericksburg, VA), this academic year has seen the evolution of a blogging platform used by faculty and staff into a Web-hosting space where students can use an array of tools to build their own academic identities, with no limits. And the idea is catching on: Since UMW started its project, Davidson College (NC) has received a Mellon Grant to work on digital curriculum, including individual student domains, and Emory University (GA) is piloting the student domain concept in a writing program. A Domain of One's Own The UMW project, called ""A Domain of One's Own,"" actually grew out of efforts of a campus group researching e-portfolios. ""We found that the term e-portfolio means many different things to different people, depending on which needs you want to address,"" said Martha Burtis,special projects coordinator in the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT). ""Out of that conversation, we asked what we could do now with the university blogging platform to take it one step further for students."" As its introductory Web page explains, A Domain of One's Own ""allows students, faculty and staff to register their own domain name and associate it with a space on a UMW-managed Web server. In that Web space, users will have the opportunity and flexibility to design and create spaces of almost unlimited possibilities. Within the system, they may install LAMP-compatible Web applications, set up subdomains and e-mail addresses, and install databases. In addition, users may choose to 'map' their domain (or a subdomain) to other services, such as ... UMW Blogs, Google Sites, or Tumblr."" The Web site's intro sales pitch to students says, ""Build out your own space on the Web to define who you are instead of having a service do it for you,"" and ""Gather the artifacts of your digital identity in a central place that you own and control."" A pilot project was conducted in 2012-2013 with 400 students and faculty. After the pilot, the university decided to expand the program by making it available to each freshman class, starting with the incoming freshmen in the fall of 2013. But as Tim Owens, instructional technology specialist, noted, DTLT staff found that although they had an engagement strategy in place, they had difficulty getting freshmen to sign up. Early usage statistics showed more activity by seniors and juniors, some of which was rollover from the pilot; others were enrolled in classes in which professors were creating domains tied to their curriculum. ""As freshmen, they have a thousand things going on when they first get here, so creating their own domain on the Web is low on that list,"" Owens said. ""Although we got some to sign up, we realized our strength was in working with faculty on integrating it as part of a course. That will inform the way we move forward. We are opening it up to anyone on the campus who wants his or her own domain. If half of the students did it, that would be 2,000."" (UMW currently has 590 domains.) Many students are using their domains to demonstrate their academic work. For instance, student Suzanna Toske uses her domain Toske Ink to display a portfolio of her work with geographical information systems. Candice Roland, a history major, uses her domain to detail her work in historical preservation. (The data is portable, and students have the opportunity within six months of graduation to port it to any domain-hosting site they choose.) Burtis and Owens say 30 faculty members have their own domains, many as part of courses in which they work with their students on digital projects. These domains are less about student identity, but they do allow students to do some sophisticated group projects. ""One of the key things is allowing students to explore a lot of possibilities,"" Burtis said. In a geography class, for example, students might be tasked with creating digital presentations and interactive maps. ""They can build representations of their research that are much more powerful than a written paper."" Students have access to tools such as Omeka, an open source content management system for digital humanities. ""We can provide access to that in a way we couldn't provide easily in the past,"" she added. Making History Susan Fernsebner, an associate professor of history, created a domain for the first semester of a two-semester history methods seminar. In the second semester, each student will have his or her own domain. In this class, they created a domain around the Taiping Civil War in China. ""I wanted to have a project that would let them work cooperatively,"" Fernsebner explained. ""I decided a Web site project would work."" She had them look at other digital sites about the topic, including Wikipedia, and then asked them to design their own. ""Rather than just writing papers for me, they are creating something for a public audience,"" she said. ""I have shared it with an American Historical Association conference and an Association of Asian Studies meeting. The students are using it as an example of their work as they apply for internships."" This site provides an introduction to the Taiping Civil War (1850-1864). Students compiled three resources for students of the conflict: An annotated bibliography and interview with Dr. Tobie Meyer-Fong, author of What Remains: Coming to Terms with Civil War in 19th Century China (Stanford UP, 2013) A timeline of major events and related primary source texts from the conflict. A map of sites as well as related primary source texts from the conflict. Fernsebner said DTLT's Ryan Brazell was instrumental in helping the students with the mapping and timeline projects. Students learned how to integrate the primary sources with the technology and visual presentation tools. Often Fernsebner and the students were on the same learning curve. ""I am pretty comfortable with digital technology, but some of the applications are new to me,"" she said. ""And sometimes I wasn't present when the students received the training, so they ended up teaching me, and that was an empowering moment for them. They developed some real confidence."" A Cultural Shift Owens said the Domain of One's Own project has presented some challenges for DTLT: ""It has been a change in the way we do our job. We are shifting to saying yes when faculty or students are interested in trying something new. The sky is the limit for them, but at the same time they and we have to realize we are limited in our expertise in using many tools."" Burtis agreed. ""We have a whole different perspective on support now. We have a bounded set of things we can do as a department,"" she said. ""We can give you the world, but the approach has to be agile and helping users find answers for themselves. It is a cultural shift, a multiyear one."" There were fewer concerns about students publishing inappropriate comments or content, she said. ""We have a track record of open publishing on the Web, so we have learned what to expect, and we don't have a lot of issues with inappropriate content, because this is linked to students' academic identity. We do some education about the practicalities of copyright issues."" In a recent blog post, Burtis called A Domain of One's Own the most complex project she's ever worked on ""in terms of the moving parts of technology, the complexity of support, and the need to help users conceptualize the space in very deep (and often challenging) ways. I have no doubt that as A Domain of One's Own grows and matures, our understanding of it will continue to evolve. We are, in effect, creating a platform for deep cultural transformation at the university. Such transformation is not easy or neat, and we must remain mindful of this."" Another recent development has been the creation of a community site that aggregates the activity of the project, including sites created and content published. ""We are just getting started on that process of sharing across disciplines and cross-pollinating ideas,"" Owens said. In addition, Fernsebner is working with a digital scholars institute on campus, which holds regular meetings to share ideas across disciplines. Burtis believes student, faculty and class domains open up a window to the intellectual life of the university. ""Universities spend a lot of time thinking about how to make connections and promote their work through their Web presence. Some schools have a large marketing department,"" she noted. ""But through these sites we are exposing the life of the mind of the university in real time on the open Web, and using the Web in the way it was originally designed for."" Pilots on Other Campuses This year, 30 English classes are participating in the pilot Domain of One's Own at Emory University. Its Web site notes that the program offers students ""a unique opportunity to register their own personal Web domain as a digital portfolio of especially innovative coursework. Participating classes will be at all levels from first-year composition to graduate school."" Among the initiatives in the expansion of digital studies at Davidson College is ""Davidson Domains,"" which will provide every Davidson student a unique domain name and access to an open source platform such as WordPress. The program will begin in 2014 as a pilot using several sections of the required first-year writing course, with first-year students in 2015-2016 as the first full participants. "
Tom Vander Ark,Getting Smart,"""Encourage Writing with a Domain"," Blog & Portfolio""",gettingsmart.com-0http:-0,"Every learner (i.e., everyone) should have a domain–a place to share what they are learning and a collection of personal bests. Why? There are probably a dozen reasons. More writing for one—and writing for public audiences which promotes authenticity, clarity, and humility. A domain can build  agency and encourage learning and reflection beyond the formal curriculum. It can boost motivation, expression, and creativity. Students could pick up a few coding skills. An intentionally curated portfolio could boost employability. With cheaper web hosting and great–often free–tools, a growing number of schools and universities are encouraging learners to create a domain and a digital portfolio. The University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia provides its faculty and 5,000 students with a domain to, ""Explore the creation and development of their digital identities."" The Domain of One's Own initiative facilitates WordPress installation, provides technical support, and hosts the site until graduation–and then the domain and content remains the student's. Students write about anthropology, the Internet, 3d printing and GIS mapping. In her exhaustive and otherwise dark review of 2014, Audrey Watters called Domain of One's Own one of the most important initiatives in EdTech and notes that it has spread to multiple campuses this year – Davidson College, Emory University, the University of Oklahoma, and CSU Channel Islands are all now piloting ""Domain""-like initiatives. We'd love to see secondary schools join the wave and, in addition to a take-home device, provide a portable domain for every student.

Carrie Schroeder,carrieschroeder.com,Tiger Domains Pilot,http://carrieschroeder.com/tigerdomains.html/,2015-04-20,"Pacific students often enter careers where they are expected to analyze and disseminate information publicly on the web. Additionally, internet platforms are increasingly used for volunteer work, political engagement, creative expression, and community or interest groups. Tiger Domains: A Domain of One's Own Pilot will create a campus collaboratory for developing student, faculty, and staff digital literacies. The objectives of the pilot phase of Tiger Domains are: 1. Create a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) for training in web tools and digital pedagogies. The FLC will leverage existing faculty expertise in the field of Digital Humanities to expand opportunities for faculty and students. Campus mentors Terri Johnson of the CTL and Carrie Schroeder of Religious and Classical Studies will facilitate the FLC. 2. Provide server space and support to FLC and students for public scholarship on their own domains. These will come from Jim Groom's Reclaim Hosting company; Groom teaches and directs the Domain of One's Own project at the University of Mary Washington. Groom will come to campus for an onsite visit and provide remote consultation throughout the year. (http://umwdomains.com) The web tools will include installations of frequently used platforms such as WordPress and Omeka. All websites developed in the pilot project will be fully transferrable to independent domains and hosting sites if Tiger Domains does not continue past 2015-16. 3. Facilitate faculty development in digital pedagogy, student digital literacies, and public scholarship. The FLC will meet before the academic year begins to learn more about Tiger Domains and the web tools and to workshop assignments. FLC members will also have 3-4 meetings per semester to continue faculty development in digital pedagogies and support each others' work. 4. Conduct campus outreach on digital pedagogy and active learning. FLC members will showcase their work at one or two public ""Digital Carnivals,"" and their students will be encouraged to present their work at the Pacific Undergraduate Research and Creativity Concert in Spring 2016. 5. Host planning conversations among campus stakeholders about future wider implementation of Tiger Domains. Tiger Domains mentors, Carrie Schroeder and Terri Johnson, will host conversations between faculty, the Library, CTL, OIT, and other stakeholders about future wider implementation of Tiger Domains. Conversations will address the program's pedagogical benefits, required infrastructure, and sustainability. Become a part of the Tiger Domains Pilot Want to incorporate public research and writing, building a website, or curating an online exhibit into your class? Do you already do this and want to refine your pedagogy or share your experiences with others? Join a digital pedagogy Faculty Learning Community for 2015-16! Participating faculty will receive a $1000 stipend to develop an active learning assignment using web-based tools. Server space for customized installations of common web tools such as Wordpress and Omeka for courses and/or individual students and faculty will be provided by Reclaim Hosting. (Websites developed during 2015-16 can be transferred to private webhosts if desired; the FLC will also discuss the feasibility and advisability of expanding this project beyond the this academic year.) Technical and pedagogical support will be provided by Terri Johnson (CTL), Carrie Schroeder (Religious and Classical Studies), your fellow FLC members, and Jim Groom (University of Mary Washington & Reclaim Hosting) remotely and on-site during a campus visit. Funded participating faculty commit to planning meeting this spring, a one day workshop (likely in August), and 3-4 training & support meetings during each semester. Funding is limited.

Michael Feldstein,e-Literate,The EDUCAUSE NGDLE and an API of One's Own,http://mfeldstein.com/the-educause-ngdle-and-an-api-of-ones-own/,2015-06-14,"I have been meaning for some time to get around to blogging about the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative's (ELI's) paper on a Next-Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE) and Tony Bates' thoughtful response to it. The core concepts behind the NGDLE are that a next-generation digital learning environment should have the following characteristics: Interoperability and Integration Personalization Analytics, Advising, and Learning Assessment Collaboration Accessibility and Universal Design The paper also suggests that the system should be modular. They draw heavily on an analogy to LEGOs and make a call for more robust standards. In response, Bates raises three concerns: He is suspicious of a potentially heavy and bureaucratic standards-making process that is vulnerable to undue corporate influence. He worries that LEGO is a poor metaphor that suggests an industrialized model. He is concerned that, taken together, the ELI requirements for an NGDLE will push us further in the direction of computer-driven rather than human-driven classes. As it happens, ELI's vision for NGDLE bears a significant resemblance to a vision that some colleagues and I came up with ten years ago when we were trying to help the SUNY system find an LMS that would fit the needs of all 64 campuses,[1] ranging from small, rural community colleges to R1 universities to medical and ophthalmology schools to a school of fashion. We got pretty deep into thinking about the implementation details, so it's been on my mind to write my own personal perspective on the answers to Tony's questions, based in large part on that previous experience. In the meantime, Jim Groom, who has made a transition from working at a university to working full-time at Reclaim Hosting, has written a series of really provocative and, to me, exciting posts on the future of the digital learning environment from his own perspective. Jim shares the starting assumption of the ELI and SUNY that a learning environment should be ""learner-centric,"" but he has a much more fully developed (and more radical) idea of what that really means, based on his previous work with A Domain of One's Own. He also, in contrast to the ELI and SUNY teams, does not start from the assumption that ""next-generation"" means evolving the LMS. Rather, the questions he seems to be asking are ""What is minimum amount of technical infrastructure required to create a rich digital learning environment?"" and ""Of that minimal amount of infrastructure we need, what is the minimal amount that needs to be owned by the institution rather than the learner?"" I see these trains of thought emerging his posts on a university API, a personal API, and a syndication bus. What's exciting to me about these posts is that, even though Jim is starting from a very different set of assumptions, he is also converging on something like the vision we had for SUNY. In this post, I'm going to try to respond to both Tony and Jim. One of the challenges of this sort of conversation is that the relationship between the technical architecture and the possibilities it creates for the learners is complex. It's easy to oversimplify or even conflate the two if we're not very careful. So one of the things that I'm going to try to do here is untangle the technical talk from the functional talk. I'll start with Tony Bates' concerns. The Unbearable Heaviness of Standards This is the most industry-talky part of the post, but it's important for the later stuff. So if talk of Blackboard and Pearson sitting around a technical standards development table turns you off, please bear with me. Bates writes, First, this seems to be much too much of a top-down approach to developing technology-based learning environments for my taste. Standards are all very well, but who will set these standards? Just look at the ways standards are set in technology: international committees taking many years, with often powerful lobby groups and ‘rogue' corporations trying to impose new or different standards. Is that what we want in education? Or will EDUCAUSE go it alone, with the rest of the world outside the USA scrambling to keep up, or worse, trying to develop alternative standards or systems? (Just watch the European Commission on this one.) Attempts to standardize learning objects through meta-data have not had much success in education, for many good reasons, but EDUCAUSE is planning something much more ambitious than this. Let me start by acknowledging, as somebody who has been involved in the sausage-making, that the technical standards development process is inherently difficult and fraught and that, because it is designed to produce a compromise that everybody can live with, it rarely produces a specification that anybody is thrilled with. Technical standards-making sucks, and its output often sucks as well. In fact, both process and output generally suck so badly that they collectively beg the question: Why would anyone ever do it? The answer is simple: Standards are usually created when the pain of not having a standard exceeds the pain of creating and living with one. One of the biggest pains driving technical standards-making in educational technology has been the pain of vendor lock-in. Back in the days when Blackboard owned the LMS market and the LMS product category pretty much was the educational technology market, it was hard to get anyone developing digital learning tools or digital content to integrate with any other platform. Because there were no integration standards, anyone who wanted to integrate with both Blackboard and Moodle would have to develop that integration twice. Add in D2L and Sakai—this was pre-Canvas—and you had four times the effort. This is a problem in any field, but it's particularly a problem in education because neither students nor courses are widgets. This means that we need a ton of specialized functionality, down to a very fine level. For example, both art historians and oncologists need image annotation tools to teach their classes digitally, but they use those tools very differently and therefore need different features. Ed tech is full of tiny (but important) niches, which means that there are needs for many tools that will make nobody rich. You're not going to see a startup go to IPO with their wicked good art history image annotation tool. And so, inevitably, the team that develops such a tool will start small and stay small, whether they are building a product for sale, an open source project, or some internal project for a university or for their own classes. Having to develop for multiple platforms is just not feasible for a small team, which means the vast majority of teaching functionality will be available only on the most widely adopted platform. Which, in turn, makes that platform very hard to leave, because you'd also have to give up all those other great niche capabilities developed by third parties. But there was a chicken-and-egg problem. To Tony's point about the standards process being prone to manipulation, Blackboard had nothing to gain and a lot to lose from interoperability standards back when they dominated the market. They had a lot to gain from talking about standards, but nothing to gain (and a lot to lose) by actually implementing good standards. In those days, the kindest interpretation of their behavior in the IMS (which is the main technical standards body for ed tech) is that standards-making was not a priority for them. A more suspicious mind might suspect that there were times when they actively sabotaged those efforts. And they could, because a standard that wasn't implemented by the platform used by 70% of the market was not one that would be adopted by those small tool makers. They would still have to build at least two integrations—one for Blackboard and one for everyone else. Thankfully, two big changes in the market disrupted this dynamic. First, Blackboard lost its dominance, thanks in part to the backlash among customers against just such anti-competitive behavior. It is no coincidence that then-CEO Michael Chasen chose to retain Ray Henderson, who was known for his long-standing commitment to open standards (and…um…actually caring about customer needs) right at the point when Blackboard backlash was at its worst and the company faced the probability of a mass exodus as they killed off WebCT. Second, content-centric platforms became increasingly sophisticated with consequent increasingly sophisticated needs for integrating other tools. This was driven by the collapse of the textbook publishers' business model and their need to find some other way to justify their existence, but it was a welcome development for standards both because it brought more players to the table and because the world desperately needed (and still needs) alternative visions to the LMS for a digital learning environment, and the textbook publishers have the muscle to actually implement and drive adoption of their own visions. It doesn't matter so much whether you like those visions or the players who are pushing them (although, honestly, almost anything would be a welcome change from the bento box that was and, to a large degree, still is the traditional LMS experience). What mattered from the standards-making perspective is that there were more players who had something to prove in the market and whose ideas about how niche functionality should integrate with the larger learning experience that their platform affords was not all the same. As a result, we are getting substantially richer and more polished ed tech integration standards more quickly from the IMS than we were getting a decade ago. Unfortunately, the change in the market only helps with one of the hard problems of technical standards-making in ed tech. Another one, which Bates alludes to with his comment about failed efforts to standardize metadata for learning objects, is finding the right level of abstraction. There are a lot of reasons why learning objects have failed to gain the traction that advocates had hoped, but one good one is that there is no such thing as a learning object. At least, not one that we can define generically. What is it that syllabi, quizzes, individual quiz questions, readings, videos, simulations, week-long collections of all these things (or ""modules""), and 15-week collections of these things (or ""courses"") have in common? It is tempting to pretend that all of these things are alike in some fundamental way so that we can easily reuse them and build new things with them. You know…like LEGOs. If they were, then it would make sense to have one metadata standard to describe them all, because it would mean that the main challenge of building a new course out of old pieces would be finding the right pieces, and a metadata standard can help with that. Alas. Folks who are non-technical tend to think of software as a direct implementation of their functional needs, and their understanding of technical standards flows from that view of the world. As a result, it's easy to overgeneralize the lesson of the learning object metadata standards failures. But the history of computing is one of building up successive layers of abstraction. For example, TCP/IP is a low-level technical standard that enables internet servers to connect to and communicate with each other, whether that communication takes the form of sending email, transferring a file, or looking up the address of a web site. Most of us don't know about or care about what sorts of connections TCP/IP allows or doesn't allow. At our level, it is indistinguishable from LEGOs in the sense tha we see these pieces fitting together generically and we don't see a need for them to do anything else. But the programmers who built TCP/IP implemented it on top of the C programming language (which was standard in the informal sense that eventually became a Standard(TM) in the formal sense), which compiled to a number of different machine languages for different computer chips, making those chips more like LEGOs. Then other programmers created HTML and Javascript as a abstraction layers on top of TCP/IP, making web pages like LEGOs in the sense that any web server can serve any standards-conformant web page and any browser can read any such web page. From here, higher layers of abstraction get dicier, which is probably why we don't have many higher-level Standards(TM). Instead, we start getting into things called ""libraries"" and ""frameworks"". These are bits of code that are re-usable by enough developers that they are worth sharing and adopting, but not so much that they are worth going through the pain of formal standards development or become universal through some other means. And then, of course, there is just a vast amount of development on the web that is individual to the project and cannot be standardized, whether formally or informally. If you try to standardize that which is not standard, chances are that your ""standard"" will remain pretty non-standard. So there is a generic danger that if we try to build a standard at the wrong level of abstraction, we will fail. But in education there is also the danger that we will try to build at the wrong level of abstraction and succeed. What I mean by this is we will enshrine a limited or even stunted vision of what kinds of teaching and learning a digital learning environment should support into the fundamental building blocks that we use to create new learning environments and learning experiences. In What Sense Like LEGOs? To wit, Bates writes: A next generation digital learning environment where all the bits fit nicely together seems far too restrictive for the kinds of learning environments we need in the future. What about teaching activities and types of learning that don't fit so nicely? We need actually to move away from the standardization of learning environments. We have inherited a largely industrial and highly standardized system of education from the 19th century designed around bricks and mortar, and just as we are able to start breaking way from rigid standardization EDUCAUSE wants to provide a digital educational environment based on standards. I have much more faith in the ability of learners, and less so but still a faith in teachers and instructors, to be able to combine a wide range of technologies in the ways that they decide makes most sense for teaching and learning than a bunch of computer specialists setting technical standards (even in consultation with educators). Audrey Watters captured the subtlety of this challenge beautifully in her piece on the history of LEGO Mindstorms: In some ways, the educational version of Mindstorms faces a similar problem as it struggles to balance imagination with instructions. As the product have become more popular in schools, Lego Education has added new features that make Mindstorms more amenable to the classroom, easier for teachers to use: portfolios, curriculum, data-logging and troubleshooting features for teachers, and so on. ""Little by little, the subversive features of the computer were eroded away. Instead of cutting across and challenging the very idea of subject boundaries, the computer now defined a new subject; instead of changing the emphasis from impersonal curriculum to excited live exploration by students, the computer was now used to reinforce School's ways. What had started as a subversive instrument of change was neutralized by the system and converted into an instrument of consolidation."" – Seymour Papert, The Children's Machine That constructionist element is still there, of course – in Lego the toy and in Lego Mindstorms. Children of all ages continue to build amazing things. Yet as Mindstorms has become a more powerful platform – in terms of its engineering capabilities and its retail and educational success – it has paradoxically perhaps also become a less playful one. There is a fundamental tension between making something more easily adoptable for a broad audience and making it challenging in the way that education should be challenging, i.e., that it is generative and encourages creativity (a quality that Amy Collier, Jen Ross, and George Veletsianos have started calling ""not-yetness""). I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, my LEGO kits didn't look like this: If I wanted to build the Millennium Falcon, I would have to figure out how to build it from scratch, which meant I was more likely to decide that it was too hard and that I couldn't do it. But it also meant I was much more likely to build my own idea of a space ship rather than reproducing George Lucas' idea. This is a fundamental and inescapable tension of educational technology (as well as the broad reuse or mass production of curricular materials), and it increases exponentially when teachers and administrators and parents are added as stakeholders in the mix of end users. But notice that, even with the real, analog-world LEGO kits, there are layers of abstraction and standardization. Standardizing the pin size on the LEGO blocks is generative because it suggests more possibilities for building new stuff out of the LEGOs. Standardizing the pieces to build one specialized model is reductive because it suggests fewer possibilities for building new stuff out of the LEGOs. To find ed tech interoperability standards that are generative rather than reductive, we need to first find the right level of abstraction. What Does Your Space Ship Look Like? This brings us to Tony Bates' third concern: I am becoming increasingly disturbed by the tendency of software engineers to force humans to fit technology systems rather than the other way round (try flying with Easyjet or Ryanair for instance). There may be economic reasons to do this in business enterprises, but we need in education, at least, for the technology to empower learners and teachers, rather than restrict their behaviour to fit complex technology systems. The great thing about social media, and the many software applications that result from it, is its flexibility and its ability to be incorporated and adapted to a variety of needs, despite or maybe even because of its lack of common standards. When I look at EDUCAUSE's specifications for its ‘NGDLE-conformant standards', each on its own makes sense, but when combined they become a monster of parts. Do I want teaching decisions influenced by student key strokes or time spent on a particular learning object, for instance? Behind each of these activities will be a growing complexity of algorithms and decision-trees that will take teachers and instructors further way from knowing their individual students and making intuitive and inductive decisions about them. Although humans make many mistakes, they are also able to do things that computers can't. We need technology to support that kind of behaviour, not try to replace it. I read two interrelated concerns here. One is that, generically speaking, humans have a tendency to move too far in the direction of standardizing that which should not be standardized in an effort to achieve scalability of efficiency or one of those other words that would have impressed the steel and railroad magnates of a hundred years ago. This results in systems that are user-unfriendly at best and inhumane at worst. The second, more education-specific concern I'm hearing is that NGDLE as ELI envisions it would feed the beast that is our cultural mythology that education can and should be largely automated, which is pretty much where you arrive if you follow the road of standardization ad absurdam. So again, it comes down to standardizing the right things at the right levels of abstraction so that the standards are generative rather than reductive. I'll give an example of a level of ed tech interoperability that achieves a good level of LEGOicity.[2] Whatever digital learning environment you choose, whether it's next-generation, this-generation, last-generation, or whatever-generation, there's a good chance that you are going to want it to have some sense of ""class-ness"", by which I mean that you will probably want to define a group of people who are in a class. This isn't always true, but it is often true. And once you decide that you need that, you then need to specify who is in the class. That means, for every single class section that needs a sense of group, you need to register those users in the new system. If the system supports multiple classes that the students might be in (like an LMS, for example), then you'll need unique identifiers for the class groups so that the system doesn't get them mixed up, and you will also need human-readable identifiers (which may or may not be unique) so that the humans don't get them mixed up and get lost in the system. Depending on the system, you may also want it to know when the class starts and ends, when it meets, who the teacher is, and so on. Again, not all digital learning environments require this information, but many do, including many that work very differently from each other. Furthermore, trying to move this information manually by, for example, asking your students to register themselves and then join a group themselves is…challenging. It makes sense to create a machine-to-machine method for sharing this information (a.k.a. an application programming interface, or API) so that the humans don't have to do the tedious and error-prone manual work, and it makes sense to have this API be standard so that anybody developing a digital learning environment or learning tool anywhere can write one set of integration code and get this information from the relevant university system that has it, regardless of the particular brand or version of the system that the particular university is using. The IMS actually has two different standards—LIS and LTI—that do subsets of this sort of thing in different ways. Each one is useful for a particular and different set of situations, so it's rare that you would be in a position of having to pick between the two. In most cases, one will be obviously better for you than the other. The existence and adoption of these standards are generative, because more people can build their own tools, or next-generation digital learning environments, or whatever, and easily make them work well for teachers and students by saving them from that tedious and frustrating registration and group creation workflow. Notice the level of abstraction we are at. We are not standardizing the learning environment itself. We are standardizing the tools necessary for developers to build a learning environment. But even here, there are layers. Think about your mobile phone. It takes a lot of people with a lot of technical expertise a lot of time to build a mobile phone operating system. It takes a single 12-year-old a day to build a simple mobile phone app. This is one reason why there are only a few mobile phone operating systems which all tend to be similar while there are many, many, mobile apps that are very different from each other. Up until now, building digital learning environments has been more like building operating systems than like building mobile apps. When my colleagues and I were thinking about SUNY's digital learning environment needs back in 2005, we wanted to create something we called a Learning Management Operating System (LMOS), but not because we thought that either learning management or operating systems were particularly sexy. To the contrary, we wanted to standardize the unsexy but essential foundations upon which a million billion sexy learning apps could be built by others. Try to remember what your smart phone was like before you installed any apps on it. Pretty boring, right? But it was just the right kind of standardized boring stuff that enabled such miracles of modern life as Angry Birds and Instragram. That's what we wanted, but for teaching and learning. Toward University APIs Let's break this down some more. Have you ever seen one of these sorts of prompts on your smart phone? I bet that you have. This is one of those incredibly unsexy layers of standardization that makes incredibly sexy things happen. It enables my LinkedIn Connected app to know who I just met with and offer to make a connection with them. It lets any new social service I join know who I already know and therefore who I might want to connect with on that service. It lets the taxicab I'm ordering know where to pick me up. It lets my hotel membership apps find the nearest hotel for me. And so on. But there's something weird going on in this screen grab. Fantastical, which is a calendar app, is asking permission to access my calendar. What's up with that? Apple provides a standard Calendar app that is…well…not terribly impressive. But that's not what this dialog box is referring to. Apple also has an underlying calendaring API and data store, which is confusingly also named Calendar. It is this latter piece of unsexy but essential infrastructure that Fantastical is asking to access. It is also the unsexy piece of infrastructure that makes all the scheduling-related sexiness happen across apps. It's the lingua franca for scheduling. Now imagine a similar distinction between a rather unimpressive Discussions app within an LMS and a theoretical Discussions API in an LMOS. Most discussion apps have certain things in common. There are posts by authors. There are subjects and bodies and dates and times to those posts. Sometimes there are attachments. There are replies which form threads. Sometimes those threads branch. Imagine that you have all of that abstracted into an API or service. You could do a lot of things with it. For starters, you could build a different or better discussion board, the way Fantastical has done on top of Apple's Calendar API. It could be a big thing that has all kinds of cool extra features, or it could be a little thing that, for example, just lets you attach a discussion thread anywhere on any page. Maybe you're building an art history image annotation app and want to be able to hang a discussion thread off of particular spots on the image. Wouldn't it be cool if you didn't have to build all that discussion stuff yourself, but could just focus on the parts that are specific to your app? Maybe you're not building something that needs a discussion thread at all but rather something that could use the data from the discussions app. Maybe you want to build a ""Find a Study Buddy"" app, and you want that app to suggest people in your class that you have interacted with frequently in class discussions. Or maybe you're building an analytics app that looks at how often and how well students are using the class discussions. There's a lot you could do if this infrastructure were standardized and accessible via an API. An LMOS is really a university API for teaching- and learning-relevant data and functionality, with a set of sample apps built on top of that API. What's valuable about this approach is that it can support and enable many different kinds of digital learning environments. If you want to build a super-duper adaptive-personalized-watching-every-click thing, an LMOS should make that easier to do. If you want to build a post-edupunk-open-ed-only-nominally-institutional thing, then an LMOS should make it easier to do that too. You can build whatever you need more quickly and easily, which means that you are more likely to build it. Done right, an LMOS should also support the five attributes that ELI is calling for: Interoperability and Integration Personalization Analytics, Advising, and Learning Assessment Collaboration Accessibility and Universal Design An LMOS-like infrastructure doesn't require any of these things. It doesn't require you to build analytics, for example. But by making the learning apps programmatically accessible via APIs, it makes analytics feasible if analytics are what you want. It is the roughly the right level of abstraction. It is also roughly where we are headed, at least from a technical perspective. Returning to the earlier question of ""at what price standards,"" I believe that we have most or all of the essential technical interoperability standards we need to build an LMOS right now. Yes, there are a couple of interesting standards-in-development that may add further value, and yes, we will likely discover further holes that need to be filled here and there, but I think we have all the basic parts that we need. This is in part due to the fact that, with IMS's new Caliper standard, we have yet another level of abstraction that makes it very flexible. Building on the previous discussion service example, Caliper lets you define a profile for a discussion, which is really just a formalization of all the pieces that you want to share—subject, body, author, time stamp, reply, thread, etc. You can also define a profile for, say, a note-taking app that re-uses the same Caliper infrastructure. If you come up with a new kind of digitally mediated learning interaction in a new app, you can develop a new Caliper profile for it. You might start by developing it just for your own use and then eventually submit it to the IMS for ratification as an official standard when there is enough demand to justify it. This also dramatically reduces the size of the negotiation that has to happen at the standards-making table and therefore improves both speed and quality of the output. Toward a Personal API I hope that I have addressed Tony Bates' concerns, but I'm pretty sure that I haven't gotten to the core of Jim Groom's yet. Jim wants students to own their learning infrastructure, content, and identity as much as possible. And by ""own,"" he means that quite literally. He wants them to have their own web domains where the substantial majority of their digital learning lives resides permanently. To that end, he has started thinking about what he calls a Personal API: [W]hat if one's personal domain becomes the space where students can make their own calls to the University API? What if they have a personal API that enables them to decide what they share, with whom, and for how long. For example, what if you had a Portfolio site with a robust API (which was the use case we were discussing) that was installed on student's personal domain at portfolio.mydomain.com, and enabled them to do a few basic things via API: It called the University API and populated the students classes for that semester. It enabled them to pull in their assignments from a variety of sources (and even version them). it also let them ""submit"" those assignment to the campus LMS. This would effectively be enabling the instructor to access and provide feedback that the student would now have as metadata on that assignment in their portfolio. It can also track course events, discussions, etc. This is very consistent with the example I gave in my 2005 blog post about how a student's personal blog could connect bi-directionally with an LMOS: Suppose that, in addition to having students publish information into the course, the service broker also let the course publish information out to the student's personal data store (read ""portfolio""). Imagine that for every content item that the student creates and owns in her personal area–blog posts, assignment drafts in her online file storage, etc.–there is also a data store to which courses could publish metadata. For example, the grade book, having recorded a grade and a comment about the student's blog post, could push that information (along with the post's URL as an identifier) back out to the student's data store. Now the student has her professor's grade and comment (in read-only format, of course), traveling with her long after the system administrator closed an archived the Psych 101 course. She can publish that information to her public e-portfolio, or not, as she pleases. Fortuitously, this vision is also highly consistent with the fundamental structure that underlies IMS Caliper. Caliper is federated. That is, it assumes that there are going to be different sources of authority for different (but related) types of content, and that there will be different sharing models. So it is very friendly to world in which students own some data and universities own other data and could provide the ""facade"" necessary for the communication between the two world. So again, we have roughly the right level of abstraction to be generative rather than reductive. Caliper can support both a highly scaffolded and data-driven adaptive environment and a highly decentralized and extra-institutional environment. And, perhaps best of all, it lets us get to either incrementally by growing an ecosystem piece by piece rather than engineering a massive and monolithic platform. Nifty, huh? Believe it or not, none of this is the hard part. The hard part is the cultural and institutional barriers that prevent people from demanding the change that is very feasible from a technical perspective. But that's another blog post (or fifty) for another time. "
Audrey Watters,Bright - Medium,The Web We Need to Give Students,https://medium.com/bright/the-web-we-need-to-give-students-311d97713713#.2ykccqiyr,2015-07-15,"Student privacy has become one of the hottest issues in education, with some 170 bills proposed so far this year that would regulate it. These legislative efforts stress the need to protect students when they're online, safeguarding their data from advertisers as well as from unscrupulous people and companies. There's some pushback against these proposals too, with arguments that restrictions on data might hinder research or the development of learning analytics or data-driven educational software. But almost all arguments about student privacy, whether those calling for more restrictions or fewer, fail to give students themselves a voice, let alone some assistance in deciding what to share online. Students have little agency when it comes to education technology — much like they have little agency in education itself. The Domain of One's Own initiative at University of Mary Washington (UMW) is helping to recast the conversation about student data. Instead of focusing on protecting and restricting students' Web presence, UMW helps them have more control over their scholarship, data, and digital identity. The Domains initiative enables student to build the contemporary version of what Virginia Woolf in 1929 famously demanded in A Room of One's Own — the necessity of a personal place to write. Today, UMW and a growing number of other schools believe that students need a proprietary online space in order to be intellectually productive. As originally conceived at the Virginia liberal arts university, the Domains initiative provides students and faculty with their own Web domain. It isn't simply a blog or a bit of Web space and storage at the school's dot-edu, but their own domain — the dot com (or dot net, etc) of the student's choosing. The school facilitates the purchase of the domain; it helps with installation of WordPress and other open source software; it offers both technical and instructional support; and it hosts the site until graduation when domain ownership is transferred to the student. And then — contrary to what happens at most schools, where a student's work exists only inside a learning management system and cannot be accessed once the semester is over — the domain and all its content are the student's to take with them. It is, after all, their education, their intellectual development, their work. Intellectual productivity on the Web looks a bit different, no doubt, than it did at Woolf's writing desk. But there remains this notion, deeply embedded in Domain of One's Own, that it is important to have one's own space in order to develop one's ideas and one's craft. It's important that learners have control over their work — their content and their data. In a 2009 article that served as a philosophical grounding of sorts for the initiative, Gardner Campbell, then a professor at Baylor University, called for a ""personal cyberinfrastructure"" where students: not only would acquire crucial technical skills for their digital lives but also would engage in work that provides richly teachable moments…. Fascinating and important innovations would emerge as students are able to shape their own cognition, learning, expression, and reflection in a digital age, in a digital medium. Students would frame, curate, share, and direct their own ‘engagement streams' throughout the learning environment. In developing this ""personal cyberinfrastructure"" through the Domain of One's Own initiative, UMW gives students agency and control; they are the subjects of their learning, not the objects of education technology software. Having one's own domain means that students have much more say over what they present to the world, in terms of their public profiles, professional portfolios, and digital identities. Students have control over the look and feel of their own sites, including what's shared publicly. This means they have some say — although not complete — over their personal data, and in turn they begin to have an understanding of the technologies that underpin the Web, including how their work and their data circulate there. At the simplest level, a Domain of One's Own helps students build their own digital portfolio. They can be used in a classroom setting in order for students to demonstrate their learning. These portfolios can contain text, images, video and audio recordings, giving students opportunities to express themselves in a variety of ways beyond the traditional pen-and-paper test or essay. One student uses her domain to showcase her artwork. Another chronicled her semester abroad. A third student has built a living CV, highlighting her academic research as well as her work experience. Since UMW launched Domain of One's Own in 2013, other schools have picked up on the program's relevance in today's world — including Emory University, the University of Oklahoma, and Davidson College, as well as at several high schools. Domain of One's Own has also spun out a startup of sorts, Reclaim Hosting, that provides low-cost Web hosting and helps educators offer their students their own domains. Clarence Fisher introduced Domains last year to his high school students at the Joseph H. Kerr School in Snow Lake, Manitoba. ""The kids came in to the class with what I would call fair and average teen tech skills,"" he said. ""Lots of iPods, iPads, and laptops. Lots of Facebook and Instagram. But none of them had a presence online they were in control of before this."" This observation was echoed by Bryan Jackson, who has implemented Domains at Gleneagle Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia. ""I wanted them to see and be aware of all of the options and the control that they are giving up when services such as Facebook are their primary web presence,"" he said. By contrast, he introduced his students to open source platforms like WordPress, teaching them about Web standards like HTML and CSS. Often when schools talk to students about their presence on the Web, they do so in terms of digital citizenship: what students need to know in order to use technology ""appropriately."" Schools routinely caution students about the things they post on social media, and the tenor of this conversation — particularly as translated by the media — is often tinged with fears that students will be seen ""doing bad things"" or ""saying bad things"" that will haunt them forever. While some schools are turning to social media monitoring firms to keep an eye on students online, rarely do schools give students the opportunity to demonstrate the good work that they do publicly. Nor do schools give students the opportunity to decide what and when and how that public, online display should look like. It's a drawback to our digital citizenship conversations — we're concerned about what students do online but we fail to probe the ""appropriateness"" of the demands on data and content that (education) technology companies increasingly make on the students in turn. It's one of the flaws too with how privacy conversations about education technology are usually framed. Debates about what happens to student data — who it's shared with, for example — seldom include students' input. These debates do not recognize the ways in which students have already developed rich social lives online and could use help, not punishment or paternalism, in understanding how to think through the data trails they're leaving behind. There is an understandable learning curve to helping students manage their online presence via their own domain. ""At first there was a fair amount of fumbling around, Googling solutions, and trying to understand their options,"" said teacher Clarence Fisher. ""Within a week, the kids were able to understand what their options were and how their site was affected by changes they made. As time went on, we talked a lot more about technical issues (backup, recovery, privacy options, hosting laws in different countries, etc). But we also talked a lot more about digital citizenship, safety, control, design, etc. The kids saw the site much more as their own and their responsibility."" The importance of giving students responsibility for their own domain cannot be overstated. This can be a way to track growth and demonstrate new learning over the course of a student's school career — something that they themselves can reflect upon, not simply grades and assignments that are locked away in a proprietary system controlled by the school. And if a student owns their own domain, as she moves from grade to grade and from school to school, all that information — their learning portfolio — can travel with them. Education technology — and more broadly, the culture of education — does a terrible job with this sort of portability and interoperability. When a student moves to a new school, for example, they often have to request their transcript, a document that lists their courses and their grades. A transcript is by definition a copy of their education record. The transcript is often printed on a piece of paper with formal letterhead, perhaps with a watermark or stamp to show that it's ""official."" This lack of portability continues in much digital schoolwork too. Even if students are encouraged to create online portfolios or to use services like Google Apps for Education in order to store all their work, they don't actually get to take that work with them when they move or graduate. (In the case of Google Apps, you can download your files. But then you'll need to find a new place to store them.) Too often, students' work in these systems gets deleted over the summer months as schools aren't in the business of permanently storing student work. School district IT is not the right steward for student work: the student is. Giving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web, to have their scholarship be meaningful and accessible by others. It allows them to demonstrate their learning to others beyond the classroom walls. To own one's domain gives students an understanding of how Web technologies work. It puts them in a much better position to control their work, their data, their identity online. ""I want to know where my ones and zeros are stored,"" said Bryan Jackson, referring to the basic binary code in which computers ‘think.' ""And I want my students to know that that's something they can ask about, and learn to manage for themselves."" "
pfaffman,Literate Computing forum,A Domain of One's Own,https://literatecomputing.com/t/a-domain-of-ones-own/1677,2015-10-18,"Audrey Watters, posted a piece called ""The Web We Need to Give Students25"". You should go there, now, and read her post. No. Really. Go read it. It's about 1700 words; that's about 6 minutes. There she describes the University of Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own9 initiative. Students there can, at no cost to themselves, register their own domain, which the University will host while they are students. When students graduate, the domain stays in their possession and they can keep their domain and all of the data when they go. Did you read it? For the TL;DR18 crowd, I will quote this section: Giving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web, to have their scholarship be meaningful and accessible by others. It allows them to demonstrate their learning to others beyond the classroom walls. To own one's domain gives students an understanding of how Web technologies work. It puts them in a much better position to control their work, their data, their identity online. Given that I, for the first time since 1995, work at a university where neither students nor faculty can run their own servers on the school's internet connection, I do not see my university being so ""radical"" any time soon. So, I recommend that you make your own radical move. Register your own domain. Set up your very own wordpress.org server. There are lots of ways to do this, but one that I would recommend is Reclaim Hosting27. Using this link43 or entering ""literatecomputing"" as a Promotional code will give you 20% off and give me a 10% credit.) For $25 ($20 with discount) you can register a domain and get hosting for a whole year. This is a great deal, and cheaper than most textbooks. It is possible to get free hosting for a year with Amazon AWS4; it is a great thing to learn to do, but it is complicated. Before I tried out Reclaim Hosting, I read a few reviews of the site, including this one from a professor of a journalism course9. ISD581 used it Spring of 2016 and I was pleased with how it worked. Should you have your own domain name and server? I have had some type of server on the internet since before I started grad school in 1995. I know I'm not a Normal Person, but I nevertheless think that owning your own domain name is a good thing for most everyone, and knowing how to run your own Wordpress site is also a useful thing to be acquainted with. At the very least, when some tech person tells you that it is too hard or otherwise can't be done, you will know better. Reclaim Hosting27's shared hosting is all that most people will need. Even if you already have a wordpress.com blog, I recommend that you pay your $25 (or $20 using the here) and get your own domain and install Wordpress. Again, this link43 will give you a discount. (If it says $25 enter the promotional code: ""literatecomputing"". I think that it should take about half an hour. Note: This is a different (and better) thing than hosting your blog at Wordpress.com. There are lots of other applications that you can (and likely will) install. What Hosting Service to Use I recommend Reclaim Hosting27, because It is inexpensive. It is easy to use. Everyone else in your class will be using it, so you can get help. If you want to use some other service, or already have a host set up and it will enable you to install Wordpress7, Known, Moodle3 and Scalar, on your subdomains (e.g., moodle.yourdomain.com) you can give that a try. **If, however, you choose to use some other service and subsequently cannot accomplish some challenge because of that choice, you will receive a zero for this assignment.** For a frame of reference, I am an experienced system administrator and maintained a Moodle server for nearly a decade. For me, setting up Moodle would take me between 10 and 30 minutes. Using Cpanel on reclaimhosting.com, it would take less than five. What Domain Name Should I Choose? Unfortunately, all the good names are taken. That said, if you are comfortable having your name attached to your site, try to get some version of your name. You may choose to use this domain to develop a portfolio, so a professional-sounding name is a good idea. But I already have a domain! Even if you already have something like yourname.com with some site on it, I recommend that you choose some other name to use for your work here. It costs no more to get a new domain, and having Reclaim Hosting managing both your domain makes things easier. If you choose to do it some other way, you are on your own. Managing Your Internet Server It is a good bet that you have not ever managed a server on the internet. It is a little like controlling a marionette via strings and wires that you push and pull. The computer that you are controlling rather than being in the same room with you is somewhere on the internet. You don't know where. How do you figure out how to install Wordpress on Reclaim Hosting? Like this31, which will lead you to Reclaim Hosting's Installing WordPress page31. Follow those directions. What to do Register your own domain on reclaimhosting.com43. You should get a 20% ($5) discount. If you do not, and would like a discount, you can enter literatecomputing in the promo code field. Set up Wordpress at yourdomain.com (not yourdomain.com/wordpress). You can poke around ""cpanel"" to add domains and install web applications. Edit or delete the ""Hello, world!"" post so that something different is there. Extra cool points for configuring ""Let's Encrypt SSL"" and giving your site an https secure connection (it's free!). Evidence of Completion Reply-as-linked-topic, tag with #domainofonesown, and in your post include: 1.Your learning narrative about how you completed this challenge, how long it took, and anything that might be helpful for those who come after you. - a link to your brand new blog!!! (something like http://yourname.com/5, not something.yourname.com) "
